<h1>Hi there , I'm Iman ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<h2>ðŸ“–"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do and if you haven't found it yet keep looking and don't settle" (Steve Jobs)

That's inspired me to discover what I love, so I start learning Front End development.

I am a software engineer and I worked as a designer for 18 months in ' Smart Steps For Information Technology ' Company. I used tools such as Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and other tools to design website templates, create various designs to collaborate with the technical team to complete software projects.

Now I am a self-learner to become Front end Developer, I started a few months ago by learning HTML, CSS, Git, and GitHub from basics until I developed good knowledge which helped me to build basic websites.

I will do my best to learning new languages, skills, frameworks and using my design skills to support my new field as Front End Developer.
